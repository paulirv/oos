# OpenOrigin Specification (OOS)

An open specification for declaring the origin and creation process of web content.

**Think WCAG for content transparency.** Machine-readable, implementable, auditable.

## What is OpenOrigin?

OpenOrigin defines a standardized way to declare how content was created — not just "was AI involved?" but the full story of authorship, tools, and editorial process.

## Why?

The AI content transparency conversation is stuck in binary mode. The reality is a spectrum from "human wrote everything" to "fully AI-generated." Current standards don't capture this nuance.

## Status

Early development. See [docs/original-idea.md](docs/original-idea.md) for the founding concept.
