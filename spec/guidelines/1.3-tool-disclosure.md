# Guideline 1.3: Tool Disclosure

**Principle:** [Transparent](../principles/transparent.md)

AI and other tools used in content creation are disclosed.

## Intent

The tools used to create content are part of its origin story. Disclosing tools — especially AI models — gives consumers the context they need to evaluate content.

## Success Criteria

| ID | Level | Criterion |
|----|-------|-----------|
| 1.3.1 | L2 | AI tools used MUST be identified by name; if no AI tools were used, the tools array MUST be empty or omitted |
| 1.3.2 | L3 | Tool versions and specific usage MUST be documented |

## Techniques

- [T-JSON-LD](../techniques/json-ld.md) — JSON-LD with tool properties
- [T-FRONTMATTER](../techniques/frontmatter.md) — Frontmatter tool fields
