# Guideline 2.2: Role Accuracy

**Principle:** [Accurate](../principles/accurate.md)

AI and human roles are correctly characterized.

## Intent

The spectrum of AI involvement is nuanced. "AI-assisted" covers everything from spell-check to full draft generation. This guideline requires that declared roles match what each participant actually did.

## Success Criteria

| ID | Level | Criterion |
|----|-------|-----------|
| 2.2.1 | L2 | AI role MUST be described using the defined L2 role vocabulary |
| 2.2.2 | L3 | Human and AI contributions MUST be individually characterized |
