# Guideline 3.2: Discoverability

**Principle:** [Machine-Readable](../principles/machine-readable.md)

Declarations are in standard locations.

## Intent

A machine-readable declaration that can't be found is useless. Declarations must be in predictable locations — HTML `<head>`, HTTP headers, or standard frontmatter positions — so automated tools can find them without special instructions.

## Success Criteria

| ID | Level | Criterion |
|----|-------|-----------|
| 3.2.1 | L1 | Declaration MUST be in a standard location for its format |
| 3.2.2 | L2 | Declaration MUST be accessible without JavaScript execution |

## Techniques

- [T-HTML-META](../techniques/html-meta-tag.md) — Meta tags in `<head>`
- [T-JSON-LD](../techniques/json-ld.md) — Script tags in `<head>`
- [T-HTTP-HEADER](../techniques/http-header.md) — Standard response headers
