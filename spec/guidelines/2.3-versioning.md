# Guideline 2.3: Versioning

**Principle:** [Accurate](../principles/accurate.md)

Declarations are updated when content is substantially revised.

## Intent

Content changes over time. If an article was originally human-written but later rewritten by AI, the origin declaration should reflect the current state. Stale declarations erode trust.

## Success Criteria

| ID | Level | Criterion |
|----|-------|-----------|
| 2.3.1 | L2 | Declaration MUST include a date indicating when the declaration was created or last updated |
| 2.3.2 | L3 | Declaration history MUST be preserved when content is substantially revised |

## Techniques

- [T-JSON-LD](../techniques/json-ld.md) — JSON-LD with dateModified
- [T-VERSION-HISTORY](../techniques/version-history.md) — Declaration version tracking
