# Guideline 1.2: Authorship Attribution

**Principle:** [Transparent](../principles/transparent.md)

Human contributors are identified.

## Intent

When humans are involved in content creation, they should be identifiable. This connects origin declarations to real accountability.

## Success Criteria

| ID | Level | Criterion |
|----|-------|-----------|
| 1.2.1 | L2 | Human author or editor MUST be named or identified by role |
| 1.2.2 | L3 | Specific contributions of each human participant MUST be described |

## Techniques

- [T-JSON-LD](../techniques/json-ld.md) — JSON-LD with author properties
- [T-FRONTMATTER](../techniques/frontmatter.md) — Frontmatter author fields
