# Guideline 2.1: Truthful Declaration

**Principle:** [Accurate](../principles/accurate.md)

Declarations match the actual creation process.

## Intent

An origin declaration is only valuable if it's honest. This guideline establishes that declarations must represent what actually happened, not what the publisher wishes happened or thinks sounds better.

## Success Criteria

| ID | Level | Criterion |
|----|-------|-----------|
| 2.1.1 | L1 | The declared origin category accurately reflects the creation process |
| 2.1.2 | L3 | Publisher maintains records supporting the declared origin |
