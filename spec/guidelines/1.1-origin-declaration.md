# Guideline 1.1: Origin Declaration

**Principle:** [Transparent](../principles/transparent.md)

Content declares its origin.

## Intent

Every piece of content should carry a declaration of how it was created. This is the foundational act of transparency — the declaration itself.

## Success Criteria

| ID | Level | Criterion |
|----|-------|-----------|
| 1.1.1 | L1 | Content MUST include an origin category from the L1 vocabulary |
| 1.1.2 | L2 | Content MUST include a structured origin breakdown with roles and tools |
| 1.1.3 | L3 | Declaration MUST include a process description with named stages and actors |
