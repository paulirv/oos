# Guideline 1.1: Origin Declaration

**Principle:** [Transparent](../principles/transparent.md)

Content declares its origin.

## Intent

Every piece of content should carry a declaration of how it was created. This is the foundational act of transparency — the declaration itself.

## Success Criteria

| ID | Level | Criterion |
|----|-------|-----------|
| 1.1.1 | L1 | Content includes a basic origin category declaration |
| 1.1.2 | L2 | Content includes a detailed origin breakdown |
| 1.1.3 | L3 | Content includes a complete creation process narrative |
