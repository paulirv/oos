# Guideline 4.1: Progressive Complexity

**Principle:** [Practical](../principles/practical.md)

Higher conformance levels add detail, not replace lower ones.

## Intent

L2 is a superset of L1. L3 is a superset of L2. A publisher who achieves L3 also conforms at L1 and L2. There's no "skip to Level 3" — you build up.

## Success Criteria

| ID | Level | Criterion |
|----|-------|-----------|
| 4.1.1 | L2 | L2 declarations MUST include all L1 required fields |
| 4.1.2 | L3 | L3 declarations MUST include all L1 and L2 required fields |

The property that L1 declarations are valid without L2/L3 data is a design property of the specification, not a per-content requirement. See [Conformance: Design Properties](../conformance.md#design-properties).
