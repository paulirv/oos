# Principle 4: Practical

Conformance is achievable for publishers of any size.

## Intent

The spec is designed for real-world adoption. A solo blogger can conform at Level 1 with one meta tag. A newsroom can conform at Level 3 with full provenance chains. Neither should feel the spec wasn't designed for them.

## Rationale

Specs that only work for large organizations don't get adopted. WCAG succeeded because Level A was achievable. OpenOrigin follows the same pattern: the entry point is trivially simple, and complexity is opt-in. The hardest part of any standard is the first implementation — make that easy.

## Guidelines

- [4.1 Progressive Complexity](../guidelines/4.1-progressive-complexity.md) — Higher levels add detail, not replace lower ones
- [4.2 Minimal Burden](../guidelines/4.2-minimal-burden.md) — L1 conformance requires minimal effort
- [4.3 Implementation Flexibility](../guidelines/4.3-implementation-flexibility.md) — Multiple valid implementation paths exist
