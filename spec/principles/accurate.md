# Principle 2: Accurate

Declarations truthfully represent the creation process.

## Intent

Origin declarations reflect what actually happened during content creation. Declarations are not marketing claims or aspirational statements — they are factual descriptions of process.

## Rationale

Transparency without accuracy is worse than silence. A false "100% human-written" claim on AI-generated content undermines the entire system. The spec must encourage honest declaration, even when the honest answer is complex.

## Guidelines

- [2.1 Truthful Declaration](../guidelines/2.1-truthful-declaration.md) — Declarations match actual process
- [2.2 Role Accuracy](../guidelines/2.2-role-accuracy.md) — AI and human roles are correctly characterized
- [2.3 Versioning](../guidelines/2.3-versioning.md) — Declarations are updated when content is substantially revised
