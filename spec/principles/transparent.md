# Principle 1: Transparent

Content origin is openly declared.

## Intent

Publishers make the origin and creation process of their content visible to consumers, search engines, and other systems. Transparency means proactively disclosing — not hiding behind ambiguity or omission.

## Rationale

Trust in content depends on knowing where it came from. As AI tools become standard in content creation, silence about process reads as evasion. Transparency converts a trust deficit into a trust signal.

## Guidelines
