# Level 1: Basic Conformance

The minimum viable declaration. One element declaring content origin category.

## Required

| ID | Guideline | Criterion |
|----|-----------|-----------|
| 1.1.1 | Origin Declaration | Content includes a basic origin category declaration |
| 2.1.1 | Truthful Declaration | The declared origin category accurately reflects the creation process |
| 3.1.1 | Structured Format | Declaration uses a recognized OpenOrigin format |
| 3.2.1 | Discoverability | Declaration is in a standard location for its format |
| 3.3.1 | Interoperability | At least one recognized format is used |
| 4.1.1 | Progressive Complexity | L1 declarations are valid without L2/L3 data |
| 4.2.1 | Minimal Burden | Conformance is achievable with a single declaration element |
| 4.3.1 | Implementation Flexibility | Any recognized format achieves conformance |

## Origin Categories (L1 Vocabulary)

The L1 origin category is a single value from a controlled vocabulary:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `human` | Content created entirely by humans, no AI tools used in drafting |
| `human-ai-assisted` | Humans created the content with AI assistance (editing, suggestions, research) |
| `ai-human-edited` | AI generated initial content, humans substantially edited |
| `ai-human-reviewed` | AI generated content, humans reviewed but made minimal changes |
| `ai-generated` | Content generated by AI with no significant human editing |

## What L1 Looks Like

```html
<!-- HTML meta tag — the simplest implementation -->
<meta name="openorigin" content="human-ai-assisted">
```

```
# HTTP header
OpenOrigin: human-ai-assisted
```

```yaml
# Frontmatter
openorigin: human-ai-assisted
```

That's it. One declaration. L1 conformance achieved.
